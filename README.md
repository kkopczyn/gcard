1. The Four Perspectives for Government


Customer -> The International Community

The international community are the customers of the United States or your governmental entity. Other countries or areas buy our products and provide meaning and value to our activities the same way customers do to a corporation. We could use a reminder that the world is our client. 

Internal -> The Citizens 

The people are the heart and soul of the government. The same way a corporation must make sure its internal process function smoothly, the government must make sure that the American people are taken care of and can productively produce the goods, services, and ideas that make America great. Metrics include: true unemployment rate, poverty rates, gdp, growth, graduation rates, wage gaps, trade surpluses and deficits.

Learning -> Learning

Just as in a corporation, the government has employees. Those employees must be constantly developing. Constantly learning the best ways to improve themselves. It's a shame that a job in government isn’t the most prestigious assignment possible. Its entirely in the capacity of government to make it so. 

Financial -> Financial 

Simple as it sounds, metrics on the Government’s revenue, expenditure, debt.
